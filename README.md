## 🔧 Development

### Current Development Workflow

The project is structured for easy activation of portfolio sections:

1. **All components are implemented** and ready in their respective files
2. **Imports are active** in `app/page.tsx` for immediate use
3. **Components are commented out** in JSX for controlled activation
4. **Configuration is complete** with all portfolio data ready
