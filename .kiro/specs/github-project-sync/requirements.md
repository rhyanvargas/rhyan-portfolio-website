# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically sync project data from GitHub repositories to the portfolio website by fetching project.json files, transforming the data, and dynamically generating project cards. The system will include automated weekly synchronization to keep the portfolio up-to-date with the latest project information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want to automatically fetch project metadata from my GitHub repositories, so that I don't have to manually update my portfolio configuration every time I create or update a project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL fetch project.json files from specified GitHub repositories
2. WHEN a repository contains a project.json file THEN the system SHALL parse and extract the project metadata
3. IF a repository does not contain a project.json file THEN the system SHALL skip that repository and continue processing others
4. WHEN fetching fails for a repository THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining repositories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want the fetched project data to be normalized and validated, so that all projects display consistently on my portfolio regardless of variations in the source data format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project data is fetched THEN the system SHALL validate it against a predefined schema
2. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log validation errors and exclude invalid projects
3. WHEN data is valid THEN the system SHALL normalize field names and data types to match the portfolio configuration format
4. WHEN transforming data THEN the system SHALL map GitHub project data to the PortfolioConfig projects interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see dynamically generated project cards that reflect the latest project information, so that I can view current and accurate project details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the portfolio loads THEN it SHALL display project cards generated from the synced GitHub data
2. WHEN project data is updated THEN the portfolio SHALL reflect the changes without manual intervention
3. WHEN rendering projects THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing featured/other project categorization
4. WHEN displaying projects THEN the system SHALL preserve the current visual design and layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want the system to automatically sync project data weekly, so that my portfolio stays current without manual maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Action is configured THEN it SHALL run automatically every week
2. WHEN the sync process completes successfully THEN it SHALL update the portfolio configuration file
3. WHEN the sync process fails THEN it SHALL send notifications and maintain the existing project data
4. WHEN changes are detected THEN the system SHALL commit and deploy the updated configuration
