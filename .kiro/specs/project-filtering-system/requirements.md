# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will redesign the current project skills and roles system to enable users to filter projects based on multiple criteria. Currently, projects have a simple `role` field and `tech` array, but users need a more sophisticated filtering system that allows them to discover projects by specific skills, technologies, project types, and other relevant attributes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to filter projects by specific technologies, so that I can quickly find projects that demonstrate expertise in technologies I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display filter controls for technologies
2. WHEN a user selects one or more technology filters THEN the system SHALL show only projects that include those technologies
3. WHEN a user clears technology filters THEN the system SHALL display all projects again
4. WHEN multiple technology filters are selected THEN the system SHALL support both "AND" and "OR" filtering modes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to filter projects by role or project type, so that I can see projects that align with specific types of work I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display filter controls for project roles/types
2. WHEN a user selects a role filter THEN the system SHALL show only projects that match that role
3. WHEN a user selects multiple role filters THEN the system SHALL show projects that match any of the selected roles
4. WHEN no role filters are selected THEN the system SHALL display all projects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to filter projects by skill categories, so that I can discover projects that demonstrate specific skill areas beyond just technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the projects section THEN the system SHALL display filter controls for skill categories
2. WHEN a user selects skill category filters THEN the system SHALL show projects that demonstrate those skills
3. WHEN multiple skill categories are selected THEN the system SHALL show projects that match any of the selected categories
4. WHEN skill and technology filters are combined THEN the system SHALL show projects that match both criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio owner, I want to assign multiple skills and categories to each project, so that projects can be discovered through various filtering paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of multiple skill categories
2. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of multiple role types
3. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing tech arrays
4. WHEN a project has multiple categories THEN the system SHALL make it discoverable through any of its assigned categories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see filter results update in real-time, so that I can quickly explore different combinations without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes any filter THEN the system SHALL update the displayed projects immediately
2. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show a count of matching projects
3. WHEN no projects match the current filters THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to reset all filters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see which filters are currently active, so that I can understand why certain projects are being shown or hidden.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL visually indicate which filters are active
2. WHEN multiple filters are active THEN the system SHALL show all active filters clearly
3. WHEN a user wants to remove a specific filter THEN the system SHALL allow individual filter removal
4. WHEN a user wants to clear all filters THEN the system SHALL provide a "clear all" option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the filtering system to work well on mobile devices, so that I can explore projects effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the filtering system on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide an accessible mobile interface
2. WHEN filters are applied on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain good performance and usability
3. WHEN viewing filtered results on mobile THEN the system SHALL display projects in an optimized mobile layout
4. WHEN the filter controls take up screen space THEN the system SHALL provide a way to collapse/expand them on mobile
