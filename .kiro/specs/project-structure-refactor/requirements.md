# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the existing Next.js 15 portfolio application to follow modern App Router best practices and full-stack architecture patterns. The current project has a basic structure but lacks proper organization for scalability, maintainability, and follows outdated patterns. The restructuring will organize components, utilities, types, schemas, and data management according to industry standards while maintaining the existing functionality and configuration-driven approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want a well-organized directory structure that follows Next.js 15 App Router best practices, so that I can easily locate files, understand the architecture, and scale the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL organize directories according to Next.js 15 App Router patterns with `app/`, `lib/`, `components/`, `types/`, `schemas/`, and `data/` folders
2. WHEN components are organized THEN the system SHALL separate UI components in `components/ui/` from feature components in `components/`
3. WHEN utilities are organized THEN the system SHALL place shared utilities in `lib/utils/` and server actions in `lib/actions/`
4. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL centralize TypeScript interfaces and types in a dedicated `types/` directory
5. WHEN data validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas organized in a `schemas/` directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with data structures, I want properly typed interfaces and validation schemas, so that I can ensure type safety and data integrity throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN portfolio data is used THEN the system SHALL define TypeScript interfaces in `types/portfolio.ts`
2. WHEN data validation is required THEN the system SHALL create Zod schemas in `schemas/portfolio.ts` that match the TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN configuration data is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate it against the defined schemas
4. WHEN new data structures are added THEN the system SHALL follow the established typing and validation patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer managing application utilities, I want organized helper functions and server actions, so that I can reuse code efficiently and maintain clean separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are needed THEN the system SHALL organize them in `lib/utils/` with specific files for different concerns (formatters, validators, etc.)
2. WHEN server-side operations are required THEN the system SHALL place Server Actions in `lib/actions/`
3. WHEN database or external API connections are needed THEN the system SHALL organize them in appropriate `lib/` subdirectories
4. WHEN shared constants are used THEN the system SHALL define them in `lib/constants.ts`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with mock data and development resources, I want organized data files and proper asset management, so that I can develop and test features without requiring external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock data is needed for development THEN the system SHALL organize it in a `data/` directory
2. WHEN static assets are used THEN the system SHALL maintain proper organization in the `public/` directory
3. WHEN development data is required THEN the system SHALL provide seed data that matches production data structures
4. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL have access to realistic mock data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the existing portfolio functionality, I want all current features to work seamlessly after restructuring, so that no functionality is lost during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing portfolio sections (hero, about, experience, projects, contact)
2. WHEN components are moved THEN the system SHALL update all import paths to use the new structure
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL display the same UI and functionality as before restructuring
4. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN the system SHALL continue to use the centralized portfolio config as the single source of truth
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile successfully without errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for future full-stack features, I want the project structure to support API routes, middleware, and server-side functionality, so that I can easily add backend features when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are needed THEN the system SHALL have a proper `app/api/` structure ready for Route Handlers
2. WHEN middleware is required THEN the system SHALL have `middleware.ts` properly configured at the root level
3. WHEN server-side data fetching is needed THEN the system SHALL have patterns established for Server Components and Server Actions
4. WHEN authentication or protected routes are added THEN the system SHALL support route groups like `(auth)` and `(dashboard)`
